<h1>Intstructions</h1>
<h3>Step 1 </h3>
In order to run the ./compile.sh you will need 'sudo'. Some machines do not come with sudo pre-installed, so if you need to install it, use
apt-get install sudo

<h3>Step 2</h3>
To make the scripts executable: chmod +x compile.sh
				chmod +x run.sh

<h3>Step 3</h3>
If you do not have node.js installed on your computer, the compile script will install it and all dependencies for you
sudo ./compile.sh  


<h3>Step 4</h3>
Run sudo ./start.sh [PORT] to start up the server on the port you want (default port is 8000).
