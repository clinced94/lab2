# Intstructions
#### Step 1
In order to run the ./compile.sh you will need 'sudo'. Some machines do not come with sudo pre-installed, so if you need to install it, use
> apt-get install sudo

#### Step 2 
To make the scripts executable: 
> chmod +x compile.sh
> chmod +x run.sh

#### Step 3
If you do not have node.js installed on your computer, the compile script will install it and all dependencies for you
> sudo ./compile.sh  


#### Step 4
Run the 'run' script to start up the server on the port you want (default port is 8000).
> sudo ./run.sh [PORT]
